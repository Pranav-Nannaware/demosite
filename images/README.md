# Images Directory

This directory contains all the image assets for the CMR Institute of Technology website.

## Required Images

For the website to function properly, you need to add the following images:

1. **logo.png** - The main logo of the institution (already provided as SVG)
2. **slider1.jpg**, **slider2.jpg**, **slider3.jpg** - Hero slider images (1920x800px recommended)

## Image Guidelines

- Use high-quality, professional images
- Optimize images for web (compress without significant quality loss)
- Use descriptive filenames
- Ensure proper licensing for all images
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios within each section

## Placeholder Images

For development purposes, you can use placeholder image services like:

- https://placeholder.com/
- https://picsum.photos/

Example usage:
```html
<img src="https://picsum.photos/800/600" alt="About CMRIT">
```

Replace these with actual images before deploying to production.
